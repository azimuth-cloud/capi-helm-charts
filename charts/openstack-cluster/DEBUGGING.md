## Provisioning Stages

This section describes the various milestones that occur between the initial creation of an openstack-cluster [Helm release](https://helm.sh/docs/glossary/#release) and a fully functional workload cluster which is ready to use. At each step in the list below, some commonly encountered issues are highlighted; however, this should not be treated as an exhaustive list and further investigation may be required on a case by case basis.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In all of the code snippets below, any command targeting the Cluster API management cluster will be denoted with `--kubeconfig capi-mgmt` whereas those targeting the workload cluster will use `--kubeconfig workload`.

When an instance of the openstack-cluster Helm chart is installed on a CAPI management cluster, the provided Helm values are used to generate a set of Kubernetes yaml resources which are then applied to the cluster. The generated resources can be viewed using the Helm CLI:

```
helm --kubeconfig capi-mgmt get manifest <release-name>
```

To instead generate a more concise list of the resource types, use something like

```
helm --kubeconfig capi-mgmt get manifest <release-name> | grep ^kind: | uniq -c
```

which will generate output similar to

```
    1 kind: ServiceAccount
   12 kind: Secret
    1 kind: Role
    1 kind: RoleBinding
    1 kind: Deployment
    1 kind: Cluster
   12 kind: HelmRelease
    1 kind: KubeadmConfigTemplate
    1 kind: KubeadmControlPlane
    1 kind: MachineDeployment
    2 kind: MachineHealthCheck
    8 kind: Manifests
    1 kind: OpenStackCluster
    2 kind: OpenStackMachineTemplate
```

The two key top-level resources in the above list are the `Cluster` and `OpenStackCluster` resources. The creation of the `OpenStackCluster` resource is the cue for the [Cluster API provider OpenStack](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-openstack) (CAPO) to begin interacting with the OpenStack APIs for the target cloud.

### OpenStack Networking components

After performing some initial validation on the provided configuration, the `capo-controller-manager` pod will create various OpenStack resources. Depending on the provided Helm values, the created resources may include an OpenStack tenant network and subnet, a Neutron router connecting the tenant network to the configured external network and an Octavia load balancer for the workload cluster's Kubernetes API server. The creation of these resources (and any errors encountered) will be logged in the `capo-controller-manager` pod, the logs for which can be inspected using

```
kubectl --kubeconfig capi-mgmt logs -n capo-system deployment/capo-controller-manager
```

and should show messages such as

```
I0730 14:27:45.708588  1 openstackcluster_controller.go:432] "Reconciling network components" controller="openstackcluster" controllerGroup="infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io" controllerKind="OpenStackCluster" OpenStackCluster="<namespace>/<cluster>" namespace="<namespace>" name="<cluster>" reconcileID="<id>" cluster="<cluster>"
```

The progress of these steps can also be monitored using the OpenStack Horizon dashboard or the `openstack` CLI.

> [!WARNING]
>
> #### Cluster autoscaler crash-looping
>
> During the provisioning of a workload cluster, the cluster autoscaler pod running on the CAPI management cluster will not start correctly until the workload `kubeconfig` secret is available, which in turn cannot happen until the API server's load balancer has been provisioned (since the IP for the loadbalancer is required to populate the `host` field within the kubeconfig). Therefore, an autoscaler pod in `CrashLoopBackoff` state is **extremely unlikely** to be the root cause of any cluster creation issues. If the pod is crash looping then first check that all of the OpenStack networking resources have been correctly provisioned and that there are no OpenStack API errors in the CAPO controller manager logs.

Commonly encountered issues at this stage (usually visible in the CAPO controller logs) include:

- Incorrectly formatted cloud credentials (see [these docs](./README.md#openstack-credentials)).

- Insufficient quota in the target OpenStack project (for various resources such as networks, subnets, security groups etc).

- Incorrect network names, IDs or other filters (e.g. if both an ID and a name are provided simultaneously in network filter config then CAPO might do [unexpected things](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-openstack/blob/6560f8882a2aa7ece3d13d47f2f2badbcba348c3/api/v1beta1/types.go#L160)).

### First control plane node

After creating any necessary networking resources, the CAPO controller will create the first control plane node. Once the node has initialised successfully, the output of the `kubeadm init` command should be visible in the server logs (visible e.g. in the OpenStack Horizon dashboard):

```
 Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!
```

> [!NOTE]
> The server logs will also display some messages which mention running manual `kubeadm join` commands for the remaining cluster nodes. This is just the standard help text output from `kubeadm` and should be ignored. No manual kubeadm commands are required - the remaining cluster nodes will join the cluster automatically.

Commonly encountered issues (usually visible in the CAPO controller logs) include:

- Insufficient quota in the target OpenStack project (for servers, volumes etc.)

- Network routing issues between the CAPI management cluster and the workload cluster

### Essential Addons

Now that the first control plane node has initialised successfully, we can begin to interact with the workload cluster's API server. At this point, the kubeconfig for the workload cluster will have been written to a Kubernetes `Secret` named `<cluster-name>-kubeconfig` on the CAPI management cluster. The contents of the kubeconfig file can be extracted for use with `kubectl` using the following command:

```
kubectl --kubeconfig capi-mgmt get secret <cluster-name>-kubeconfig -o go-template='{{.data.value | base64decode}}' > workload
```

The workload cluster's API server can be queried using this kubeconfig, for example, by running

```
kubectl --kubeconfig workload get nodes
```

which should show at least 1 control-plane node with status 'Ready'.

The [cluster-api-addon-provider](https://github.com/azimuth-cloud/cluster-api-addon-provider) will now begin to install the workload cluster addons. Progress can be monitored with

```
kubectl --kubeconfig capi-mgmt get helmreleases,manifests -A
```

where each `helmrelease` resource on the management cluster represents a [Helm release](https://helm.sh/docs/glossary/#release) that will be installed on the workload cluster. Similarly, each `manifest` resource represents a set of ad-hoc Kubernetes manifests which will be installed on the workload cluster.

The logs for the addon provider can be viewed with

```
kubectl --kubeconfig capi-mgmt logs -n capi-addon-system deployment/cluster-api-addon-provider
```

and should include messages such as

```
[INFO    ] command succeeded: helm upgrade cni-calico-monitoring /tmp/tmp6c291nsx --history-max 10 --install --output json --timeout 1h --values '<stdin>' --cleanup-on-fail --create-namespace --namespace tigera-operator --reset-values --version 0.1.0+27028c0a --wait --wait-for-jobs --kubeconfig /tmp/tmpsn88ktuu
```

which indicate successful installation of addons on the workload cluster. The corresponding Helm releases on the workload cluster can be viewed with

```
helm --kubeconfig workload list -Aa
```

If the addons stall during installation for an extended period of time (e.g. 10 minutes or more) then it is possible that one or more of the the addon provider's `helm upgrade --install` commands have encountered an error. If this happens, start by checking for any `helmreleases` on the management cluster that are not yet in a `Deployed` state then investigate the corresponding resources for that Helm release on the workload cluster, including any pods which are not in a `Running` state. Further investigation into the root cause of the issues for any problematic pod may be required.

Possible errors at this stage include (but are not limit to):

- Failure to create `PersistentVolume` resources on the workload cluster which are required by some addons (e.g. the `kube-prometheus-stack` and `loki-stack` Helm releases which are part of the monitoring stack addon). This may be caused by insufficient volume quota in the target OpenStack project or other Cinder CSI misconfiguration on the workload cluster.

- Failure to create `Service` resources of type `LoadBalancer` on the workload cluster (e.g. if the NGINX ingress controller addon is enabled). This again may be caused by insufficient OpenStack quotas or permissions.

- Network IP range clashes. For example, the [workload cluster's internal network config](https://github.com/azimuth-cloud/capi-helm-charts/blob/37ab14468c5b6abeec75aa12e5328bb6468e84c8/charts/openstack-cluster/values.yaml#L34-L45) may clashes with other important IP addresses such as the CIDR for the OpenStack subnet on which the cluster was provisioned or some cloud-specific on-site DNS servers. In this case, the workload cluster's internal networking config may need to be modified via the Helm values.

### Remaining Nodes and Addons

Once the essential addons which are required for a functional cluster (e.g. a [CNI](https://github.com/azimuth-cloud/capi-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/cluster-addons#container-network-interface-cni-plugins)) have been installed, the remaining control plane and worker nodes for the cluster will be provisioned and the addon installation process will proceed until all workload cluster addons are installed.

Any errors while provisioning the remaining cluster nodes will appear in the `capo-controller-manager` pod logs on the management cluster.

Any errors encountered while installing the cluster addons will likely appear either in the `cluster-api-addon-provider` pod logs on the management cluster, in the output of `helm --kubeconfig workload list -aA` on the workload cluster, or in any of the logs or events for pods in an unready state on the workload cluster.
